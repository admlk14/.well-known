You also need to set up service discovery so that Apple can reach the Intune service and retrieve enrollment information. To complete this prerequisite, set up and publish an HTTP well-known resource file on the same domain that employees sign into. Apple retrieves the file via an HTTP GET request to `“https://contoso.com/.well-known/com.apple.remotemanagement”`, with your organization's domain in place of `contoso.com`. Publish the file on a domain that can handle HTTP GET requests.
